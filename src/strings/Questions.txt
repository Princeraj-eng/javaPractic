# Java String Practice for Interviews

This document serves as a compilation of Java string-related interview questions and their solutions for practice.

## Questions

        1. **Reverse a String**
           Write a program to reverse a given string without using in-built methods.

        2. **Check Palindrome**
           Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

        3. **Count Vowels and Consonants**
           Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

        4. **Find Duplicates**
           Identify and count duplicate characters in a string.

        5. **String Anagram Check**
           Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

        6. **Remove Duplicates**
           Remove duplicate characters from a string while maintaining order.

        7. **Character Frequency**
           Find the frequency of each character in a string.

        8. **First Non-Repeated Character**
           Find the first non-repeated character in a string.

        9. **Reverse Words in a Sentence**
           Reverse the order of words in a sentence.

        10. **Check Substring**
            Check if one string is a substring of another without using in-built methods.

        11. **String Compression**
            Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters (e.g., "aaabb" -> "a3b2").

        12. **Remove a Character**
            Remove a specific character from a string.

        13. **Find Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
            Find the length of the longest substring in a string without repeating characters.

        14. **Convert String to Integer**
            Write a method to convert a string to an integer (implement your version of `Integer.parseInt`).

        15. **String Rotation Check**
            Check if one string is a rotation of another string (e.g., "abcd" and "cdab").
